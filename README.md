# advent-of-code-2019

My own solutions for <https://adventofcode.com/2019>.

I wrote everything on a Jupyter notebook using Python 3.6. No further
requirements, just the Python standard library.

While the code on the notebook is mine, all the input files were downloaded
from the website. These files are included in the repository because they are
needed for running the code from the notebook.
